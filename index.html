      <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>I grew up on a farm in southern Minnesota where I helped my father and grandfather manage hundreds of acres of corn and soybeans. 
          I started college when I was 16 years old at Minnesota State University, Mankato, and then transferred to Montana State University 
          to study computer science before deciding to focus on English composition. (I enjoyed website design and programming at the time, 
          but I really enjoyed my work writing and editing in the MSU Writing Center.)</p>
        
      <h3>South Korea</h3>
      <p></p>
      
      <h3></h3>
      <p>After graduating, I wanted to become fluent in a second language, so I found a job teaching English to children in Ulsan, South Korea 
        (the center of the Hyundai corporate empire) and enrolled in Korean classes at Ulsan University to study before work every morning. 
        After one year of study, my Korean teacher suggested that I move to Seoul and study at her alma mater, Seoul National University. 
        For six amazing months, I lived with a wonderful homestay family (who took me in as their own) and spent four hours every day studying 
        Korean language and culture.</p>
      <p>I had originally planned on returning to America to attend graduate school, but I wanted to continue to improve my Korean-language skills. 
        After a series of interviews, I started working as an English academic instructor at Pagoda in the Gangnam area of Seoul. For five years, 
        I taught executives, engineers from Samsung and Hyundai, and students preparing to attend graduate school throughout the world. In addition 
        to interviewing prospective students and writing instructional content for students and other instructors, I taught between 8-10 hours of 
        classes each day.</p>
      
      <h3>Content Writing for Corporate Instruction</h3>
      <p>In 2009, I received a South Korean long-term residence visa and started the more challenging work of corporate training, content writing, and 
        curriculum design for large South Korean companies and universities. From 2010 to 2015, I traveled throughout Seoul and the whole Korean 
        peninsula taking on more and more work.</p>
