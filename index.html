      <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>I grew up on a farm in southern Minnesota where I helped my father and grandfather manage hundreds of acres of corn and soybeans. 
          I started college when I was 16 years old at Minnesota State University, Mankato, and then transferred to Montana State University 
          to study computer science before deciding to focus on English composition. (I enjoyed website design and programming at the time, 
          but I really enjoyed my work writing and editing in the MSU Writing Center.)</p>
        
      <h3>South Korea</h3>
      <p></p>
      
      <h3></h3>
      <p>After graduating, I wanted to become fluent in a second language, so I found a job teaching English to children in Ulsan, South Korea 
        (the center of the Hyundai corporate empire) and enrolled in Korean classes at Ulsan University to study before work every morning. 
        After one year of study, my Korean teacher suggested that I move to Seoul and study at her alma mater, Seoul National University. 
        For six amazing months, I lived with a wonderful homestay family (who took me in as their own) and spent four hours every day studying 
        Korean language and culture.</p>
      <p>I had originally planned on returning to America to attend graduate school, but I wanted to continue to improve my Korean-language skills. 
        After a series of interviews, I started working as an English academic instructor at Pagoda in the Gangnam area of Seoul. For five years, 
        I taught executives, engineers from Samsung and Hyundai, and students preparing to attend graduate school throughout the world. In addition 
        to interviewing prospective students and writing instructional content for students and other instructors, I taught between 8-10 hours of 
        classes each day.</p>
      
      <h3>Content Writing for Corporate Instruction</h3>
      <p>In 2009, I received a South Korean long-term residence visa and started the more challenging work of corporate training, content writing, and 
        curriculum design for large South Korean companies and universities. From 2010 to 2015, I traveled throughout Seoul and the whole Korean 
        peninsula taking on more and more work.</p>
      <p>My largest project was with YBMSisa.com. I assisted the sales team in the presentation for the Korean Electric Power Corporation language-instruction 
        contract. KEPCO was in the process of selling their nuclear technology to the UAE, and they wanted to outsource the development of an immersive 
        English language and culture program for their employees. I designed 2-, 4-, and 8-week programs where KEPCO SMEs met for eight hours of daily 
        instruction. For the eight-week program, I created 320 hours of instructional units, lessons for instructors, and  materials for students.</p>
      <p>Through YBM.com, I coached executives at Interpark (the South Korean tech giant), employees at CJ Foods (Samsung’s confectionary branch), and 
        government art curators at the National Museum of Korea. During this time, I also continued to work with the marketing and sales teams to 
        successfully procure new contracts for YBMSisa.com.</p>
      <p>At Pagoda21.com I began by coaching executives who were engaged in international sales at SK Energy and SK Telecom. I wrote and designed content 
        for language learning and met with each executive twice a week to improve their English language skills. I also took on several clients at 
        Yonsei University where I helped medical doctors/professors edit drafts of journal articles, practice speeches, and prepare for sabbaticals 
        at American university hospitals like Harvard, Stanford, and the Mayo Clinic. During this time, I also volunteered to teach English to 
        hospitalized children in the rehabilitation center, which was one of my favorite things to do in the afternoons before going home for 
        the day.</p>
      <p>In 2012, our young family and I moved to a small suburb in the outskirts of Seoul and also started my own business. In our neighborhood 
        there were many after-school activities for children to study English, but there were no schools or classes for adults. I targeted this 
        group of people and, through posters and online advertising, developed a small but tightly-knit group of clients who I worked with in 
        the afternoons and evenings from 2012-2015.</p>
      <h3>America</h3>
      <p>As I continued to develop and expand business for YBMSisa.com and my own school, I was starting to see places where I might require 
        additional training in curriculum and instruction. So in 2015, I applied to the dual-license and master’s program at the University of 
        Minnesota’s Department of Curriculum and Instruction. In May 2015, we moved from Seoul to Eden Prairie, Minnesota, and I received training 
        at the U of M on up-to-date instructional methods, curriculum design, and content creation.</p>
      <p>Our original plan was to return to South Korea and our work in Seoul, but I began teaching writing to middle school students and loved it. 
        From 2016 to 2020, I taught students how to code switch on job applications, write scripts for podcasts and videos, and write different types 
        of printed/materials. </p>
      <h3>Writing Focus</h3>
      <p>The big change, though, came in 2020 when I was paired with an exceptional writer to create an online learning environment in response to 
        the real-time needs of the pandemic.</p>
      <p>Due to the unique nature of our situation (creating a wholly new online learning environment), we threw out a majority of the legacy 
        learning materials we were given and developed new baseline documentation sets to better help our students learn. While our district had 
        been using iPads and Canvas Learning Management System for years, the hardware and software had never been central to learning because 
        instructors had always been able to deliver information in person and collect materials directly from students. Because we were never 
        going to see our students in person or collect materials directly from them, we essentially merged several of our product lines into a 
        common technology platform. We had to do this because we were told by students and families that legacy materials were often 
        “too technical” for students working at home without the direct supervision and support of their peers and/or instructors. </p>      
      <p>Before 2020, I spent the majority of my time instructing instead of creating content, but that changed at the start of the 
        pandemic; for the first time since my work with YBMSisa.com, I started spending more time writing content than instructing. And I 
        loved it. I loved recording videos and audio lessons. I loved modifying older materials and creating new content. I loved writing 
        with focus accessibility and LMS UX to create content that both students and other staff members enjoyed using. </p>
      <p>Currently, I am enrolled in the graduate school at the University of Minnesota with a focus on technical communication, writing 
        with digital technologies, and UX. I am looking forward to using my extensive experience in content writing and technical writing 
        to return to the corporate field. </p>
      <p>Please feel free to contact me any time to let me know how I can best meet the needs of your organization.</p>
